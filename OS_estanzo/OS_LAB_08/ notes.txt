pipes are used for interprocess communication.
Two Ways for interprocess communication(IPC)
wait and pipes

3, 4 two pipes are created and they use the 0 and 1 file descriptors
the process write in output 1 descriptors
the process read from input file 0 descriptors 
pipes open files so we have also need to close the pipes just like files

dup2 => function duplicates an open file descriptors 
pfd[0] has input file descriptors
pfd[1] has output file descriptors
